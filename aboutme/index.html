    <p>Hey everyone! my name is Koy, this is my first semester on campus.</p>
    <p> I love the outdoors, hiking, nature photography etc. I am also big into reading and 3D and computer graphics, traveling and going to the gym.</p>
    <p>Currently I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, however that could change slightly.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the church and I am so grateful for that atmosphere which made me into the person that I am today</p>
