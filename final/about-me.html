    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>My name is Koy Gregerson, I am studying Computer Science at BYU - Idaho I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. Some of my other hobbies I enjoy when I'm not taking pictures are: reading, making designing CGI, satiating my horology obsession (watches), going to the gym, hiking, or spending time with family and friends Contact Me: I'm thrilled that you've taken the time to visit my photography portfolio. If you have any inquiries, comments, or project ideas, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

        <h2>My Tools:</h2>
        <p>For all of my photography I use a Sony a6100 and either my 35-50mm lens or my 50-210mm lens. I tend to use the latter more often because it allows me to shoot from farther away </p>
