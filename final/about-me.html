                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>My name is Koy Gregerson, I am studying Computer Science at BYU - Idaho I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. Some of my other hobbies I enjoy when I'm not taking pictures are: reading, making CGI, satiating my horology obsession (watches), going to the gym, hiking, or spending time with family and friends. I'm thrilled that you've taken the time to visit my photography portfolio. If you have any inquiries, comments, or project ideas, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always eager to connect with fellow photography enthusiasts, potential clients, or anyone who shares a passion for visual storytelling.</p>
